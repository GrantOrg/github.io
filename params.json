  "body": "### Welcome to Lucas Grant's Vanity page.\r\nThis page was created for the purpose of showing off who I am as a developer, and to show some of what I have learned in my class, Software Security taught by Andy Novocin.\r\n\r\n### Explanation of the class\r\nThe class was taught in c/c++ and focused on following the [CERT coding standard] (https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards)\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\nThe purpose of this page specifically is to show the projects that i was involved in creating. The Projects that are going to be talked about are called:\r\n* [Markovian Tweet Generator] (https://github.com/motu454/SSProj1)\r\n* [Minesweeper] (https://github.com/motu454/SSproj3)\r\n* [GeeMail] (https://github.com/motu454/SSproj4)\r\n\r\n### Markovian Tweet Generator\r\nFor this project, we had to consume a text file (in this case we used the Iraq constitution and the US constitution) and produced a tweet based off of the input text. The rules that were highlighted for this project included the MEM and STR rules. This Project was a basic intro to C/C++ coding. It let us show our ability to do file IO, work with vectors and maps. Overall a simple yet efficient program.\r\n\r\n### Minesweeper\r\nThis project is exactly what it sounds like. It's a program for command line minesweeper. It involved building a board based off user input, creating the bombs, allowing guesses, and bringing up the flags in accordance with bomb locations. While most of the work was done with vectors, we also had to use srand for generating the bombs. This was important because it tied into how we broke the rand() function and learned that even srand isn't completely random unless the seed is based off of outside factors that are too hard to predict. \r\n\r\n### GeeMail \r\n### GitHub link\r\nYou can find my entire GitHub page at the following link (@motu454)\r\n",
